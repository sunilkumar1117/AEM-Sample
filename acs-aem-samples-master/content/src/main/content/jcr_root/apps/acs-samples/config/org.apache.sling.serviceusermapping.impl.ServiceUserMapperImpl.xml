<!--
IN AEM6 SP2 and below, A SINGLE OSGi is used to define ALL mappings. Any OOTB mappings must be copied into this custom overlay.

User Mappings are in the format: 

* BUNDLE_ID=CRX_USER_NAME
* BUNDLE_ID:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER=CRX_USER_NAME

* The Implementing BundleId can be found in the Bundle's POM
  * If no Service Account Name is specified in the Consumer (the authInfo map is Null or Empty) the "bundle-level" user will be used
* The Service Account Name, is specified in the consumer to pick the service account
* The CRX Principal Name is the CRX user that will be used to power the Service Resource Resolver

user.default is used if no matching user.mappings exist
